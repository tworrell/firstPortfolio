<p><i>In Barbados</i> here is plenty of variety around the relatively small coastline; the eastern shore facing the Atlantic is certainly wilder, making it ideal for surfers.

Things are quieter in the south and even more so in the sheltered west; it is in the west where the softest sand and the largest beaches are found.

Even in the north – where there are significant cliffs, there are still small, sandy coves.

Wherever you go in Barbados, there is a beach waiting.

You are spoilt for choice, so here is some help to narrow it down – an idea of the 15 Best Beaches in Barbados.</p>
